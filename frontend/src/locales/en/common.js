Adding more documents to the Workspace make it smarter! \n\n<i>Conversational:</i> Your documents + your on-going chat history both contribute to the LLM knowledge at the same time. Great for appending real-time text-based info or corrections and misunderstandings the LLM might have. \n\nYou can toggle between either mode \n<i>in the middle of chatting!</i>",
